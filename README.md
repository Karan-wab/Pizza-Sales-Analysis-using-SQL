# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL
 Conducted a comprehensive sales analysis project on a pizza delivery dataset using advanced SQL queries to uncover actionable business insights.
 Extracted key performance metrics such as total revenue, order frequency, and peak order times. Identified top-performing pizzas by quantity and revenue,
 analyzed category wise demand, and evaluated time based sales trends. Used window functions and aggregation techniques to compute cumulative
 revenue, percentage contribution by pizza type, and average daily pizza orders. Delivered insights on customer preferences such as popular pizza sizes and
 chicken-based pizza trends, enabling data-driven strategies for inventory, marketing, and menu optimization.
